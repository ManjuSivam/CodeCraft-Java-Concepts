1. one core executes one thread at a time
2. 1 core with 2.5 GHz speed => can execute 2.5 * 10^9 operations / second
    for eg, 1 thread does 10000 operations
    single core processor can do 4 * 10000 operations within a second
3. Steps to execute a task in diff thread
    * Create a Task.
        -> Create a Task class.
        -> Make this class implement Runnable interface.
        -> Implement the run() method.
            The run() method contains the code to be executed in the new thread.
    * Create a Thread.
        -> Create thread object.
    * Assign the task to the thread.
        -> Pass task object inside the constructor of thread class.
    * Start the thread.
        -> thread.start();
