1. We can have a method without implementation.
    But need to declare the class as abstract.
    Abstract KW cannot be associated with variables
2. Class should be abstract if there is atleast ONE abstract method.
3. If all methods are abstract -> 100% abstraction
4. Cannot create object of abstract class
5. It is mandatory for the child classes that extends abstract classes to implement the abstract methods
    If not implementing the abstract methods, declare the child class as also abstract
6. constructor in the abstract class cannot be abstract. Constructor code can be run by super() from the child class
