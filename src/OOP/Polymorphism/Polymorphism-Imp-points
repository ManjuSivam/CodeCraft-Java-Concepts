Polymorphism -> Same thing; diff behaviour
Compile time polymorphism -> Method overloading
    Same method name with change in no of params or type of params
    return type doesn't matter
    JVM knows which method to call in the compile time itself
Run time poly -> Method overriding
    Inheritance is must
    Should store child obj in parent type reference
